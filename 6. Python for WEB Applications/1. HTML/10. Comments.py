HTML comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.

HTML Comment Tag

    You can add comments to your HTML source by using the following syntax:
    <!-- Write your comments here -->

    Notice that there is an exclamation point (!) in the start tag, but not in the end tag.


    You can also hide more than one line, everything between the <!-- and the --> will be hidden from the display.
    Example

    Hide a section of HTML code:
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <!--
    <p>Look at this cool image:</p>
    <img border="0" src="pic_trulli.jpg" alt="Trulli">
    -->
    <p>This is a paragraph too.</p>
